# GitHub Pages Setup

This folder contains the HTML file for your incident communication decision tree.

## Steps to Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new public repository on GitHub.
2. Upload `index.html` and `README.md` to the root of the repository.
3. Go to the repository's **Settings**.
4. Scroll to the **GitHub Pages** section.
5. Under "Source", select the branch (e.g., `main`) and folder as `/root`.
6. GitHub will generate a public URL like:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

You can embed this URL in your SharePoint site using the Embed web part.
